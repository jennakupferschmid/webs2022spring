    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Jenna Kupferschmid and I am currently a sophomore at the University
    of Pittsburgh majoring in communications with certificates in public and professional
    writing and digital media. At the University I have become proficient in Canva, Photoshop, Audacity
    Excel, Powerpoint, Github, Atom, and Word.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am a tour guide witin the Pitt Pathfinders organization at the University.
      Within the Pathfinder organization I was responsible for leading the summer social media accounts and successfully
      worked on deadline-driven projects with a small group of colleagues in order to produce marketing
      content for the organization. Additionally, I consistently lead group throughout campus and faciliate
      communication between our officer team and prospective students. I am also on the General Board of my sorority,
      Alpha Epsilon Phi, where I help organize events for the 100+ person chapter.</p>


    <p> I plan to take all my past experiences to gain success in the marketing and public relations fields in the future.</p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>


    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
