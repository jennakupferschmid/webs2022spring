<div class='row'>
    <div class='column-2-items'>Hi! My name is Jenna Kupferschmid and I am currently a sophomore at the University
    of Pittsburgh majoring in communications with certificates in public and professional
    writing and digital media. At the University I have become proficient in Canva, Photoshop, Audacity
    Excel, Powerpoint, Github, Atom, and Word.<br /><br />Currently, I am a tour guide witin the Pitt Pathfinders organization at the University.
      Within the Pathfinder organization I was responsible for leading the summer social media accounts and successfully
      worked on deadline-driven projects with a small group of colleagues in order to produce marketing
      content for the organization. Additionally, I consistently lead group throughout campus and faciliate
      communication between our officer team and prospective students. I am also on the General Board of my sorority,
      Alpha Epsilon Phi, where I help organize events for the 100+ person chapter.<br /><br />I plan to take all my past experiences to gain success in the marketing and public relations fields in the future.</div>
